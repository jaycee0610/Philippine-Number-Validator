### Validate Mobile Network Operator

The `form` element with the ID `form` handles the submission of mobile numbers for validation. The JavaScript code processes the numbers and categorizes them based on their prefixes.

### Generate Random Numbers

The `generateRandom` button generates a list of random mobile numbers and displays them in the textarea.
